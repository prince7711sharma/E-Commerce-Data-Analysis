# 📊 E-commerce Data Analysis using SQL & Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing an **E-commerce dataset** using **MySQL** for querying and **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** for visualization.  
The goal is to extract **business insights** about customers, orders, sellers, and sales trends by solving **15 SQL queries**, categorized into **Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced** levels.

## 🗂️ Dataset Description
The project uses 7 CSV files from the e-commerce dataset:

- `customers.csv` → Customer details (ID, city, state)  
- `orders.csv` → Order information (timestamps, status)  
- `sellers.csv` → Seller details (ID, location)  
- `products.csv` → Product catalog (category, attributes)  
- `geolocation.csv` → Zip codes, latitude/longitude, cities, states  
- `payments.csv` → Payment details (method, installments, value)  
- `order_items.csv` → Items per order (product, seller, price, shipping)

## 🔍 Analysis & Queries

### **Basic Queries**
1. List all unique cities where customers are located  
2. Count the number of orders placed in 2017  
3. Find the total sales per category  
4. Calculate the percentage of orders that were paid in installments  
5. Count the number of customers from each state  

### **Intermediate Queries**
6. Calculate the number of orders per month in 2018  
7. Find the average number of products per order, grouped by customer city  
8. Calculate the percentage of total revenue contributed by each product category  
9. Identify the correlation between product price and the number of times a product has been purchased  
10. Calculate the total revenue generated by each seller, and rank them by revenue  

### **Advanced Queries**
11. Calculate the moving average of order values for each customer over their order history  
12. Calculate the cumulative sales per month for each year  
13. Calculate the year-over-year growth rate of total sales  
14. Calculate the retention rate of customers (customers who make another purchase within 6 months)  
15. Identify the top 3 customers who spent the most money in each year
